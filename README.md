Introduction

This is an AWS CloudFormation template that can be used to launch a complete myBB stack, featuring basic security settings, logs storage and system monitoring.

Also, it can be used as template for deploying similar stacks like: PHP + Apache

MySQL under segmented AWS VPCs and AWS Subnets, featuring some monitoring with NewRelic and logs viewing/storage with AWS CloudWatch.
Requirements

There are 2 requirements that you must fill to get the whole stack properly working:

AWS Account: You need a AWS Account and enough privileges in order to launch a CloudFormation stack. If there is no such privilege, your request are not going to be processed and the whole stack are not going to be created.

1 AWS EC2 Key Pair: You need that a Key Pair be available to be inserted into your brand new EC2 instances. Without that, you are not going to be able to connect into the EC2 instances by means of SSH. So make sure you have one.

There is a monitoring requirement that is optional but highly recommended to met. Create a New Relic account and make sure you get an access key:

Inside New Relic dashboard, click into your avatar and name, which are located in the up right corner from the screen, then click in "Account settings". Then you must get the "License key" [2] that is located bellow the "Account information" section.

Deployment Procedures

Full Procedure

In order to create a myBB stack, follow the instructions bellow:

Log into AWS Console.

Goto "Services" -> "CloudFormation".

Click in "Create Stack".

In "Choose template" section, mark "Upload a template to Amazon S3".

Within "Upload a template to Amazon S3" section, click in "Browse".

Choose the file "mybb.json" located in this package.

Click in "Next".

Fill all the form fields, making sure you defined:

Stack name
DBPassword
KeyName
NewRelicLicenseKey (if applicable) [2]
OperatorEMail [3]
Click "Next".

In "Options" step you can leave all as is and then click in "Next"

In "Review" step you are going to be required to accept the following capabilities "AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile" and "AWS::IAM::Role", so scroll down the web page, check a box right the message "I acknowledge that this template the cause AWS CloudFormation to create IAM resources."

Click in "Create".

Check your Mail Box for a message with the following subject: "AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation", once you found that get into the message and click in "Confirm subscription". By doing this, every relevant step from CloudFormation will be informed to your E-Mail address [3].

You will be redirected to the main CloudFormation screen and now you have to wait the stack creation. When the status moves from "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS" to "CREATE_COMPLETE", check it out the stack tab called "Output" and you will see the URL which was provided to your application by the means of a "Value" attributed to a "Key" called "WebsiteURL" and a comment besides saying "ELB URL for newly created myBB stack".

All done, you should see the myBB welcome screen. The next section will provide you the credentials you need to get into as the board admin.

myBB Default Credentials

Once the setup is done, you can sign into myBB with a default credential that is meant to be used by the application administrator. Into the login page, just fill the form with the following values:

Username: admin

Password: 4dm1np4ss0rd

By using the credentials above, you should get logged as the board admin. So you can access the restrict content and do admin stuff like backups and change the topics organization.

PLEASE CHANGE THE CREDENTIALS right after you get logged into the system.

Design Goals

Some goals were stablished to get the solution evaluated and for every one of them here is a briefly description explaining how we achieve that goals:

VPC and subnets deployment One VPC is created by the CloudFormation template along 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets, which were respectively dedicated to WebServers/ELBs and RDS Database machines. By segmenting the network this way, we ensure that RDS Database machines are not exposed to the world and the traffic must pass from one network to another, exclusively.

Security groups configuration Three Security groups are intent to control the whole solution. The "LoadBalancerSecurityGroup" allows only TCP/80 traffic for Inbound and Outbound, being the door for the Internet, so the requests does not came directly into WebServers, which are located behind the Elastic Load Balancer. "WebServerSecurityGroup" allows the TCP/80 for Inbound coming only from the hosts that belongs to "LoadBalancerSecurityGroup", so if you are not our ELBs there is no Web page for you. Also, the "WebServerSecurityGroup" allows the SSH traffic from the address range you can inform into "SSHLocation" from CloudFormation options and it enables us to get our network very restrictive if we want to. The "DBEC2SecurityGroup" makes possible the communication between the WebServers (which are EC2 instances) and the Database Servers (which are RDS instances), allowing only the traffic from TCP/3306. Please note that using RDS with VPC Security Groups is a modern approach, different from using the EC2-Classic model, which we avoided in order to get things more flexible and reliable.

Securing DB in cloud The Database servers are instantiated inside 2 Private Subnets, that are located in different AvailabilityZones, so a MultiAZ deployment is possible within our CloudFormation stack, and if you do not want to it is ok, because it is also configurable by the MultiAZDatabase option located in the "Specify Details" screen from the stack creation steps (Section 3). The segmentation made into the VPC allows a strong logic separation between the machines, so no malicious traffic can flow from one subnet to another one. Also, there are Private Network ACLs, which restricts even more the allowed traffic, posing a hard design feature into the network configuration that is the fact the Security Groups can even specify a more permissive traffic, but if it is not allowed by the Private Network ACL related to the Private Subnet no damage can be done.

Monitoring performance using AWS and other tools This feature resembles us the fact that when we have a fleet of servers it is a hard task to inspect them and find the properly debug messages that a malfunctioning application is writing to some log files. So there was created a monitoring using the CloudWatch log streams, which enables you to inspect key messages from the most important logs in the system located into every single server from the fleet. Just go to "CloudWatch", then "Logs" and select your Log Group based on the name you gave to the CloudFormation stack. There you gonna find every server with its own log file by service and you can inspect them by the range of time you wish. Just remember that they are retained for a period of 7 days and after that, all of them are properly rotated. You can see that there are an alarm configuration to watch for CPU utilization and if it is too high, another machine will be provisioned and the contrary effect is valid too when the resources are idle and there is a need for cool down the servers and save money. An integration was made to the third party tool called "New Relic Dashboard" and it provide us an insight full view from our server fleet point of view, relating CPU, Memory, Disk, Network in a more detailed fashion and we also have the advantage of seeing what is going on inside our application, getting informations about things like Slow DB Queries, Transactions, Load Time per page, User Page Loading, External Resources, API Calls and etc.

Autoscaling By getting integrated to CloudWatch metrics on CPU usage, we can scale our WebServers up and down, depending on our needs. You can even setup into CloudFormation configurations [3] a variable called "WebServerCapacity" that says the initial number of servers our fleet will start operating. When a machine reaches more than 90% from CPU usage for 10 minutes, another one is launched. When there is no need for extra machines, the policy will cool down the fleet reducing its size down to a number that can sustain the operations.

Using of RDS There are two options using RDS, which was configured to work with MySQL: MultiAZDatabase is meant to control if there will be a deployment with a main machine and a standalone one, providing a better result in terms of high availability. If there is no interest in having this kind of deploy, it is ok to work with a single machine into a single AZ, because it is optional. One thing that is important to note is the employed security, which was made using VPC Security Groups instead of the old generation ones, called DB Security Groups. The used approach is more modern and flexible.

Known Limitations

There is a serious limitation while autoscaling. The virtual machines does not know about each other's filesystem. So while the session problem can be mitigated while using ELB stickness and single database, there are files being different among all Web Servers, so one might upload some file which reffers to a single machine storage and others will not able to access that file. This can be solved by using csync2, NFS, GlusterFS, some S3 storage plugin for myBB or anything else capable of getting all files stored into a single place.

There is one limitation related to the Elastic Load Balancer setup, which could be done with 2 ELBs linked to EC2 instances. But for that we must assume one DNS domain should be used to it. It is possible to determine in Route53 that a DNS record is an alias to an A object and in this case we could setup a Master Load Balancer to be aliased to its record and get another Load Balancer linked as its fallback. Then, we let Route53 monitoring them and deciding who should be responding at a given point time.

Conclusion

From the technical point of view, the presented solution met all the design goals and there is a room for a lot of improvements, such a more in depth configuration, extending the functionality from this stack by using good defaults but letting the user to get a more detailed configuration done. Also, it could be done a work related to get Elastic Load Balancers high available too by linking them to a Route53 record as aliases and specifying that one of them should be the Main Load Balancer and the another one is its fallback.
